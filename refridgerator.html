			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Influencer Marketing Is Not Accessible To Small Businesses</h1>
			<p>The rise of ad-blockers has increased the popularity of influencer marketing with brands looking to promote their products in a more authentic way. However, influencer campaigns are very costly and it's hard for businesses to know what they're getting in return for their investment. Marketers can look at the numbers of likes and comments that the influencers’ posts get, but that does not tell them anything about their return on investment (ROI). The big brands circumvent this problem by working with top celebrities and trusting that the millions of likes will translate into something, but that’s something that smaller businesses cannot afford. Our goal was to make influencer marketing accessible to businesses of all sizes.</p>

	<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="mb-4">Our Approach</h1>
			<p>My team consisted of a marketer, a business consultant, an engineer, and myself. Our strategy was establish partnerships with businesses in our customer segment in order to design a solution tailored to the needs of their marketing teams. We achieved this by interviewing marketers and executives early on, and working with them to generate wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. Our goal was to have a clear understanding of our target customers’ willingness to pay before starting any development. </p>

			<h1 class="mb-4">User Insights</h1>
			<p>Our market and customer research revealed the following insights that defined the vision and strategy for our solution:</p>

			<div class="row mt-4">

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 mb-3">
					<h2>Use Influencers to Drive Sales 💰</h2>
					<p>The primary customer segment are e-commerce companies with more than 2M in annual revenue and seeking to drive business growth using influencer marketing.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 mb-3">
					<h2>Investing in Influencers Feels Like Gambling 🙏</h2>
					<p>Customers invest less than 10% of their marketing budgets in influencers because it feels like putting money in a black box: it’s impossible to know if it’s working or if they are throwing money out the window.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 mb-3">
					<h2>Success Depends on Fit Between Product and Audience 💕</h2>
					<p>Customers want to see that the influencer’s audience is the right fit for the product being sponsored. Metrics that reflect this are high engagement rates, clickthroughs to social media page and company website, and ideally online sales.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 mb-3">
					<h2>Tracking ROI is Hard and Tedious 😩</h2>
					<p>Customers spend 30% of their time manually tracking the performance of their influencers by logging number of likes/comments/shares, managing referral links, and observing website traffic. It's the least enjoyable part of running an influencer marketing campaign.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 mb-3">
					<h2>Influencer Marketing Campaigns Are Always On ⏰</h2>
					<p>Customers seek to work with the same influencers on a regular basis because it takes a lot of time to negotiate agreements the first time, and because it’s perceived as an effective strategy to build brand awareness with the influencer’s audience.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
					<h2>Influencer marketing is al about relationships 🙋</h2>
					<p>Marketers enjoy collaborating with influencers and are proud of the personal relationships they have established with them.</p>

			<h2>The Solution</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Introducing LikeWallet</h1>
			<p>LikeWallet is a web app for marketers that tracks the impact that influencers have on their business. Users can add influencers to their LikeWallet account, and the platform will automatically start tracking how many posts, views, likes, comments, clicks and online sales are being generated in real time. Users can also see demographic information about the audience being reached, and see how their influencers perform against each other. With LikeWallet, users can make data-driven decisions to lead their influencer marketing campaigns.  </p>

			<h2>How We Got There</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Evolving Wireframes Into High-Fidelity Prototypes</h1>
			<p>We initially reached out to five of the target customers we had interviewed during our planning phase and had expressed interest in helping us design a product for their specific needs. Using interactive mockups I created with InVision, I interviewed both marketers and executives to explain our initial ideas. The primary goals were to design the analytics dashboard and the user flow to add and manage influencers.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<h2 class="mt-3 mb-3">Early Dashboard Ideas</h2>
			<p>I initially envisioned four key sections to include in the dashboard to provide valuable data to the user:</p>
			<div class="row mt-4 mb-5">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 text-center" style="margin-bottom: 48px;"">

			</div>
			<h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Learnings and Improvements</h2>
			<p>An interesting learning after showing the mockups to customers was that they were confused by the scoring system proposed in the influencer ranking, dubbed the “LikeWallet score”. Although I had envisioned that feature as an an easy way to identify good and bad influencers (like a rotten tomatoes score for influencers!), It was clear that the customers would not blindly trust any scoring system without knowing how it was computed or how the data was collected. They wanted to have an active role in evaluating the performance of an influencer. For the next iteration, I replaced the percentage score with a more familiar 5-star rating, and changed the design to display the relevant statistics.</p>
			<div class="row mt-4 mb-5">
				<div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
					<h3 class="mb-4">Improved Rating System</h3>
					<img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/aVc0lHx.png">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Another thing I learned quickly was that the needs of customers varied greatly across companies, even within the same industry. Therefore it was clear that a static design would not suit the needs of all our users. To solve this problem, I improved the modularity of the design by switching to a card-based design. I envisioned that this would provide greater flexibility to allow users to modify the layout of the dashboard to best fit their needs.</p>

			<h2>How We Got There</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Designing and Testing User Flows</h1>
			<p>A key challenge of this project was designing an user flow to add influencers to LikeWallet and manage them. I started by using an interactive mockup to test a simple linear flow with our target users. The idea was that at the creation of a new campaign, the user would enter required information including the handles of the influencers and the amount that they would get compensated. The final step would require users to share a referral link with each influencer in order to track website traffic more accurately.</p>
			<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 text-center" style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
					<h3 class="mb-4">1. Create new campaign</h3>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 text-center">
					<h3 class="mb-4">4. Share referral links with influencers</h3>
					<img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/1RencRU.png">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Testing the flow with users revealed several areas of improvement. A key problem was that the flow did not meet the needs of users who used influencers on a regular basis. Instead of planning and running temporary campaigns, these marketeers partnered with influencers to have them continuously post throughout the year. Therefore they needed to add and manage influencers on the go, and not just at the start of a campaign.</p>
			<p>To solve this issue, I designed a dedicated page to manage influencers, which could be accessed at all times via the main navigation bar.</p>
			<div class="text-center">
				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">Adding and deleting influencers</h3>
				<div class="gifContainer">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>For users that did need to simultaneously manage campaigns with different influencers, I designed a feature to organize influencers into different groups. That way, on the dashboard, users can filter the analytics and data by group.</p>
			<div class="text-center">
				<h3 class="mb-4 mt-5">Creating groups of influencers</h3>
				<div class="gifContainer">
					<!-- <div class='gfyitem' data-id='MediumBountifulEuropeanfiresalamander' data-hd='true' data-responsive=true data-max-height="600"></div> -->

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Another problem with the initial flow involved the final step in which the user was required to send a referral link to each of their influencers. This step was problematic because it required the user to take action outside or platform and also required a response from the actual influencer, which was something we could not control. This could create a disruption in our flow that would impact the user's experience negatively.</p>
			<div class="quote text-center mt-5">"We've worked with other companies to put special code and features on our website"</div>
			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Target Customer</p>
			<p>After doing some technology research we determined that it would be possible to track website traffic driven by influencers without using a referral link. Instead, we would inject code into the customer's website to monitor internet traffic and correlate traffic spikes to posting times of influencer posts. Our initial fear with this approach was that customers would be reluctant to integrate such code into their website, but our interviews revealed that this was not the case.</p>

			<h2>How We Got There</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Testing Market Demand</h1>
			<p>With our high-fidelity and functional prototype ready, our next step was to test the market demand for LikeWallet. We first gave the prototype to the target customers we had been interviewing since the beginning in order to evaluate their willingness to pay for the product. Following that, I designed a landing page and animated an explainer video to launch a campaign on betalist.com and test how many businesses would sign up.</p>
			<div class="quote text-center mt-5">"Could I get three more seat please?"</div>
			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Target Customer</p>
			<p>The prototype was a great success with our first real users, who used it daily from the first day they got it. In fact, we started getting overwhelmed by the amount of feedback, feature requests and bug reports that we started receiving. Three companies asked if they could get more seats, and one of them offered to sign an annual contract of $10,000.</p>
			<p>The betalist campaign was also successful. From our research, we had chosen to measure it's success by tracking the number of soft signups and setting a target of 50 after a week. The campaign ended up generating about 400 visits to the landing page, with 77 conversions to a sign up.</p>

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Influencer Search Engine</h1>
			<p>This project has shown that there is a clear need and demand for more robust analytics around influencer marketing. However, during our customer discovery phase we also identified other potential areas for opportunities within the space.</p>
			<div class="quote text-center mt-5">"Instagram is filled with wannabe influencers"</div>
			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Target Customer</p>
			<p>For example, several customers expressed experiencing pain points while searching for new influencers to work with. There is a lack of tools to search for influencers, and it's extremely hard to know how well they will perform without running real trials. As a result, marketers are spending hours manually stalking social media profiles, looking for potential red flags such as bot followers and low engagement rates.</p>
			<p>I recommend pursuing this opportunity to create an end-to-end platform for influencer marketing. Our vision of making influencer marketing accessible to all can only be achieved if we create tools to help companies find the best influencers for their brand.</p>
