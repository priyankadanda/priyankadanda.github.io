		<p class="mb-2">I was a student corporate consultant for Bridgestone under Experential Learning Initiative by Krannert School of Management (Purdue). The R&D team at Ohio developed a new technology that could replace traditional air filled tires. Like many new products in technology, R&D comes before product management. The Research team wanted to present Airless tire technology to the business unit in Nashville and used ELI at Purdue to draw Product potential for Airless tires and for Bridgestone.</p>
