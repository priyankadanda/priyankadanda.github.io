			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p><strong>Research</strong> is the foundation to any successful group project. However, in many projects, teammates are <strong>disconnected</strong> while doing research individually at different times and places. This causes teams to research duplicate sources, induce personal biases into the research results, and most importantly, <strong>lose important information</strong> not shared by individuals. Our goal was to create a tool for teams that would solve these problems.</p>

Because we were both decent programmers, we challenged ourselves to design, build and launch our first minimum viable product (MVP) in one month. </p>

			<p>Yipp is a chrome extension that let's teams bookmark pages as a group so they can do online research together more efficiently.

			<h2>How We Got There</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">First MVP: Sharing Web Pages and Leaving Comments</h1>
			<p>We decided our first MVP would be a chrome extension that adds a comment section to every web page, so teams may have relevant conversations about the contents directly there (much like how you can comment inside a google doc!). The value proposition would be that users could share pages quickly from their browsers, have conversations directly on the page, and easily find previously shared links. </p>
			<p>I wanted to keep things extremely simple to quickly test the value proposition, so I limited the MVP to three features: posting a comment, choosing who can see the comment, and receiving a notification when a teammate posts a comment.</p>
			<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 text-center mb-responsive">

					<h3 class="mb-4">Receive real-time push notifications</h3>
					<img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/6aDGpVo.png">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>A key design decision was choosing how to design the comment section and how to display comments. To create a familiar experience and avoid reinventing the wheel, I initially replicated YouTube’s approach, placing the input bar and new comments at the top. However, because I wanted the commenting experience to feel more like a conversation, I styled the elements to look like a chat application. This created a contrast that confused users. When I showed the first screens to users, I was surprised to learn that four out of five believed that the most recent comment was the bottom one (which was in fact the oldest!). I decided to go all-in with the chat-like interface, so I moved the input bar to the bottom and reversed the order of the comments.</p>

				</div>
			</div>

			<p>We built the MVP in a one month sprint, and gave it to our first 20 users to test our value proposition. I pre-selected specific users that matched our target segment: all were students currently working on a group project, or planning an important activity with their friends, like a vacation trip. I onboarded them personally to observe their first impressions, and arranged to interview them a week later to gather their feedback.</p>

			<p>I decided to measure the success of the MVP using qualitative data rather than quantitative because I cared about discovering more user insights, and the small number of participants would make the data statistically insignificant anyways. After interviewing each user and collecting their feedback, I ranked their perceived interest in each part of the value proposition on a 3 point scale. A score of 1 meant the user was not interested in the value, a score of 2 meant it would be a “nice to have”, and a score of 3 would be a “must have”.</p>

			<img class="img-fluid screenshot mt-3 mb-5" src="https://i.imgur.com/skKUort.png" style="border: solid 1px #F5F5F5;">

			<p>The initial results were disappointing. Out of our 20 participants, not a single one was wildly excited about the value of sharing pages quickly or communicating directly on pages. During the interviews I asked users to show me different web pages they had been commenting on. I was surprised to see that most of them only had a one or two comments. Very few pages had longer conversations like those I had envisioned. Luckily the third value - finding links quickly - seemed to resonate with the participants a lot more.</p>

			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Beta Tester</p>

			<p>I focused on the 5 participants that were the most excited about this value to understand their motivations. Curiously, these users all asked for more a more robust and descriptive notification feed. Upon a closer look, I realized they were using the notification feed to build an easily accessible list of web pages that mattered to their teams. They were basically using Yipp as a social bookmarking tool!</p>

			<h2>How We Got There</h2>
			<h1 class="mb-4">Second MVP: Social Bookmarking Tool</h1>
			<p>I convinced my partner to focus on this use case, and we envisioned a second MVP. We kept the features form the first MVP, but we added new ones to turn it into a robust collaborative bookmarking tool. Users would be able to create separate collections of bookmarks, invite other contributors, and quickly add pages to collections. This time, the value propositions we wanted to test were the following:</p>
			<ul class="mt-4 mb-4">
				<li><h3>Never losing a link or web page again</h3></li>
				<li><h3>Getting information without having to ask teammates</h3></li>
				<li><h3>Discovering and learning from the content others are bookmarking</h3></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The biggest design challenge of this phase was making it straightforward to add pages to a collection. Initially, I designed it so pages would get added automatically when the user left a comment on them. This caused a lot of confusion among users because they expected such action to be tied to a button click. It was also unclear that the comment section was unique to the current web page that they were browsing.</p>
			<p>To fix this problem, I designed a menu at the top of the interface, clearly stating which web page the user is currently on, and with two action buttons: one to add the page to the collection, and another to view the comments on the page. After some testing and tweaking, I finalized the design of this menu and successfully fixed the design complexity.</p>

			<div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 text-center mb-responsive">

					<img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="https://i.imgur.com/PyCPhEf.png">
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>The most important feature of this MVP was creating and managing new collections. I designed this feature by using the design of my favorite productivity tool as inspiration: Slack. I love Slack’s channel design because it is intuitive and lends itself to having channels and workspaces for different teams, in one place. I envisioned users would also use Yipp for different group projects, so I decided to adopt the same structure.</p>

				</div>
			</div>

			<p>After two months of hard work we completed all the features for the MVP. This time we decided to test our value propositions using quantitative data by launching a public beta on betalist.com. We measured the number of extension installs after two weeks, the number of collections that each user created, and the number of pages that they bookmarked.</p>

			<p>From our research, we decided to set our success target at 100 installs. After two weeks, we got 116 installs organically. However, the other metrics weren’t as promising. Most of these users created less than 2 collections and bookmarked less than five pages. </p>

			<div class="quote text-center mt-5">"I'm already struggling to get my teammates on Trello"</div>
			<p class="text-center mb-5">- Beta Tester</p>

			<p>To understand what was happening, I talked with the ten of the least active beta testers. I wanted to figure out why they had installed the application, yet did not use it actively. I learned that they had originally been attracted by the value proposition, but quickly realized the product would only be useful if all their teammates were also active on the platform, and getting everyone to install the extension was too cumbersome. That is, the value proposition did not seem appealing enough for users to try to convince all their teammates to download Yipp. </p>
